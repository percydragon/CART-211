      <h1> Java</h1>
      <p> This is my dog Java. She's a good girl.
        But also she gets scared really easily and is a total lap dog.
        She loves curling up on you and giving you a bunch of kissies.
        10/10 best clingon.</p>

        <h1>Aquila</h1>
        <p>This is my dog Aquila. She's a bit of a late bloomer, so while she's two years old.
          She's basically still a year old puppy, but that's okay! She's super playful, and loves
          to lick people. 10/10 best chub.</p>
