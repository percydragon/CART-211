          <h1>Hi, my name's Percy Dragon</h1>
          <p class="p"> I'm not a newbie to coding, as I do have 4 years of experience with Python.
            The issue remains that I am learning different languages. Though HTML/CSS is not a coding language.
            My brother would reign hell on me if I did.

           Personally, I still have no clue what I'm doing, and that's okay. I also have no idea what exactly to write here.
           I'm sorta just testing the waters in seeing what exactly I can do, and how good I can get this basic website to look.
