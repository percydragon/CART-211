                <h1>Reflection on “As We May Think”</h1>
                <p> While the entire masculine emphasis on this paper was off putting,
                it’s sad to say that it was the norm for the era that this paper was written in.
                However, putting that discomfort aside, Vannevar Bush was a forward thinker,
                and a visionary. He was able to see that technology was advancing so quickly, and
                that greater things were to come from it.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Bush divides his new ideas into 8 different sections, and discusses
                future ideas of current technology.
                He predicts the augmentation of the simplification of mass production, as shown at
                the end of his first section when he writes: “the world has arrived at an age of cheap
                complex devices of great reliability; and something is bound to come of it.”
                He goes on to discuss the notion of a
                gopro that he calls a “walnut”, as well as the notion of automatic depth of field adjustment
                with camera lenses. A person in 1945 was able to extrapolate
                the advancements that would come in the future merely by basing
                himself off of current technologies. A personal computer,
                or as he refers a “memex”, is one of his greater thoughts,
                more for scientific purpose rather than the average individual. Still,
                its purpose is to centralize information in one specific area, as a sort of online encyclopedia,
                accessible at any given moment without much of a hassle. Frankly, he predicted Wikipedia.</p>
                <br>
                <p>It’s amazing that with enough extrapolation, we could possibly
                predict what technologies are to come, or rather, by writing what we
                think is to come, we can influence others to create it. By cementing our ideas,
                we are sure to influence others who have the means to produce, and
                further advance technology exponentially.

                <h1>Reflections on “Writing the History of the Internet”</h1>
                <p>Within this text, Rosenzweig offers the multiple origins of
                  how the Internet came to fruition. He offers the tech genius,
                  bureaucratic, military and populus perspectives to the popularity of
                  the internet. He discusses various books, and essays,
                  that discuss what certain perspectives thought was ‘the origins of the
                  Internet’.</p>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <p>Rosenzweig first discusses the Hafner and Lyon who praise the
                  ‘tech geniuses’ who created ARPANET, and how the internet was
                  formed to prosper shared computer networking, with no other
                  ulterior motives then to share information between researchers.
                  Never once, Rosenzweig explains, do Hafner and Lyon mention
                  the military, bureaucratic or populus approaches to the origins
                  of the Internet. Rosenzweig follows with Norberg and O’Neil, who
                  discuss the bureaucratic military necessity of ARPANET, and how it
                  was funded solely to better inter-communication within the military.
                  It was solely for the Department of Defense to fund better communication.
                  Again, Norberg and O’Neil never once mention the political implications
                  and cultural contexts of the Internet, and completely downplay the
                  ‘tech genius’ approach to the Internet. Again, these two people
                  sing their praises to the bureaucracy, and only that. Then Edward’s
                  essay is mentioned, that discusses the political discourse of the
                  Cold War, and how the Internet came about to be to transcend the
                  nuclear apocalypse. This origin of the Internet was circa
                  WW2/Cold War, rather than post-WW. They wanted communication
                  to be decentralized, rather than centralized, to once again,
                  have communication transcend a nuclear end. Yet, it was meant to
                  be a closed-system, and not an open system. Edwards’ discusses it
                  as a means to an end, and again, downplays certain origins of the Internet.
                  Finally, Rosenzweig discusses the populus origin of the Internet,
                  with the Haubens’ book, as well as the students who created the
                  first affordable operating system, to the radical computer
                  counterculture that commended freedom of speech and information.
                  The operating system grew exponentially before becoming the most used
                  operating system by universities.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>It’s interesting to note the entire progression of the formation
                  of the Internet, because it doesn’t have a single distinct origin,
                  but rather a progressive collective, as well as a multitude of origins.
                  Each ‘History of the Internet’ book that Rosenzweig presents takes a
                  specific stance depending on what they want to idealize, and promote.
                  Attempting to make a comprehensive history of the internet would mean
                  having to take into accordance the complex facets behind each faction,
                  and attempt to mend them together in a cohesive way.

            <h1>Reflections on “Web Work: A History of Internet Art” & “The New world of Net Art”</h1>
            <p>The first reading, by Rachel Greene, while
              possibly a comprehensive history, is completely
              dated and difficult to understand due to its
              usage of fancy language for the sake of being fancy.
              However, it lays the premise for the foundation of net.art,
              and how exactly it had come to be. Following Greene’s work,
              I read Miranda’s, which allowed a more personal understanding
              of what circa 2018 Net.art would be.</p>
              <br>
              <p>As stated, Greene’s text can be difficult to follow,
                but she gives rather concise and clear starting point to net.art,
                and what it meant back when it first started. It is in the first
                paragraph, in which she explains that net.art was an accident when
                an email sent to Vuk Cosic became mangled in transmission, and
                only the word net.art could be seen. From there, she says, net.art
                was a term used to describe mundane activities, all relating
                to the net in some way, shape of form. While she gave a list
                of examples, and I even investigated upon some of them, I could
                still barely follow what exactly was the meaning of net.art.
                While Greene finished her text saying that net.art had grown
                so much in popularity, artists found themselves becoming
                hypocritical to the original cause, some net.artists stayed
                true to the original anti-establishment, anti-capitalist virtues
                of what net.art represented. Moving forward approximately two
                decades later, Miranda describes the current world of net.art,
                and it was there I was able to make connections to this art form.
                She begins her article describing Ed Fornieles performance piece
                <i>Dorm Daze</i> that took place using Facebook. From there, I was able
                to understand net.art as more than just technical glitches using
                HTML and websites, but rather it was also a way of doing interactive
                storytelling using social media platforms. In fact, I had been
                witness to one such performance piece on the social media platform
                known as Tumblr, where a narrative had been created between a
                group of people on a blog called “sonic for real justice”.
                The blog members used Sonic characters as their personas and
                claimed to be anti-social justice and what not, but there was far
                more to it as drama began to ensue between the members of the blog.
                While absurd as it may sound, during the time of its activity,
                the events of that blog had become a reality tv show for a large
                percentage of the users of the micro blogging platform at the time.
                So much so that derivatives had been created in an attempt to jump
                onto the fame bandwagon. While Miranda does go on to cover more artists,
                it was interesting to note that the current net.artists she describes
                actually profit off of these works. It’s interesting to see the evolution of
                it, because while some would say it disregards the intent of net.art,
                I view it more as a way for artists to make for themselves, rather than
                corporations attempting to imitate net.artists for profit.</p>
                <br>
                <p>While there is an obvious difference in net.art from when
                  it originally began, to how we perceive net.art now in our
                  current age, there are obvious roots from where it began.
                  While artists can now profit off of their net.art, they
                  still retain a lot of the core values net.art promoted during
                  its original popularity. From JODI’s unintelligible website,
                  navigating the user through various pages, to glitch art,
                  photobashing and social media performance pieces. Net.art
                  will continue to evolve with time, as netizens continue to
                  create art in subversive ways.</p>
