            <h1>Internet Codependency, Internet Addiction and The Perfect Self</h1>
            <p>As of September 2018, 66.25% of the World’s population used
              Facebook as their primary form of social media, across all platforms.
              This was followed by Pintrest at a 12.84%, Twitter at 8.8%, Youtube at
              7.97%, Instagram at 1.94% and Tumblr at 0.95% (“Social Media”). As of 2015,
              more than 3.2 billion people use the Internet, according to the United
              Nations Agency (qtd. in Davidson), but only 2.14 billion of those
              users used social media (“Number of Social Network Users”). Of course,
              that number has since increased to 2.46 billion in 2017 and is projected
              to reach 3.02 billion by 2021 (“Number of Social Network Users”).
              Comparatively, the world population in 2015 was 7.3 billion, meaning
              that almost half of the world’s population has access to the Internet,
              and may use it on a day to day basis and approximately a 30% of the world’s
              population use social media. These figures may come as a shock to
              those of us living in Canada. The Internet, and access to it, has become a bare
              necessity to thrive in the current societal climate, and with it becoming
              ingrained in society, problems will occur. While the Internet and social
              media are not accessible worldwide, just yet, within the countries where
              online platforms (eg. online video games, social media) are available,
              a universal problem is emerging: Internet addiction, and Internet dependency.</p>
              <br>
              <p>It is important to note that current studies say that sex is an important predictor for Internet addiction, but despite that, the control groups used in some of the studies had skewed ratios, where the ratio of man to woman was 3:1. These studies conclude that being male can easily be a precursor to Internet Addiction. In this paper, those skewed ratios will not be taken into account. The correlation of depression to this addiction will be discussed as it relates to the sex of the afflicted individual, due to research that indicates depression as more prevalent in women than in men (Albert 219).</p>
              <br>
              <p>
                Within the 21st century, in a country such as Canada, most individuals have some sort of electronic device connected to the Internet, whether it be a smartphone, smart television, computer, laptop, tablet, etc. Most youth of the 21st century were raised on the Internet, with it being ingrained in day-to-day life. It is not simply a commodity, for some it is their primary form of entertainment and communication. Not books, not television, but rather online streaming, online gaming, chat rooms, blogging, live streams. The list can go on. For some people, the Internet is merely a means to an end, and nothing more than a device to access the information they need. For others, though, it has become a way of living, so much so that they spend more time online than in real life. This sort of phenomena can be described as Internet addiction, or Internet dependency. Despite all of the lavishly wonderful things the Internet has to offer, Internet dependency is not one of those things. While not everyone who uses the Internet have Internet addiction, people with perfectionist attitudes are more prone to developing internet addiction, no other variables included (Senormanci et al 1385). Predictive attributes do not simply stop at perfectionist attitudes. The duration of usage is also an important factor, as well as the type of format being consumed by the user. People who tend to use the Internet for longer periods of time are more likely to be subject to internet addiction, than those who use the Internet for shorter periods of time (Chen et al 62). It also seems that what an individual consumes on the Internet is an important determinant of Internet addiction. Chat rooms, social media sites and online video games create a sense of community for the Internet user. Though it may not seem like a problem that people use the Internet for longer periods of time, it takes a toll on the individual’s mental health and interpersonal relationships. While it is not certain that both depression is a precursor or an effect of Internet addiction, it is important to note that individuals afflicted with Internet addiction have depression and anxiety disorders (“New Research”). Similar research has indicated a correlation between Internet addiction and psychiatric disorders, such as bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, major depressive disorder, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (Canan et al 422 ) and an increased risk of suicidal ideation, and attempt (Lin et al 508). Individuals afflicted with Internet addiction may present themselves with different symptoms of depression, based on various factors, including sex of the afflicted individual. Women are affected more severely by Internet addiction, and the development of their depression increases drastically. These individuals will have increased conflicting interpersonal relationships due to the rapid increase of depression and isolation (Ko et al 1382). Most of the world revolves around the Internet: interaction, news and entertainment. Internet addiction is something the afflicted individual does to themselves willingly and knowingly, because they feel powerless to stop. While it may seem absurd to some, internet addiction is a serious addiction that has drastic effects on the quality of life of the afflicted individual.

                The final outcome of this project will be a non-linear narrative in the format of a blogging website and chat rooms. The concept is that an individual has found a smartphone with access to an open chat room. The chat log conversations seem mundane enough, with links sprinkled about here and there. One of these links is to the individual’s blog, that provides deeper insight into the darker afflictions of the individual. It is meant to be an uncomfortable blog, as everything is clean, white and minimalistic, with posts that are concerning in nature. References to suicide, self-harm and depression are found on the blog. The story is meant to be non-linear in nature, as the individual can chose to first read through the chat logs, and then move to the blog, or go straight for the blog. The concept may seem fairly ambitious, as I pursue development, I may focus solely on the blogging aspect of the project, to give visibility to the darker aspects I have outlined. I want to display the harmful nature of internet addiction coupled with depression, and how an individual often does it knowingly and willingly to themselves, because it is far easier to live in the digital world than in the physical one. Overwhelmed by constant bombardment of information, and uncontrollable incidents, people turn to the Internet to find comfort from a place in their lives where they can take control. Ironically they cannot control their Internet usage.

                Of course, I’m hoping to use HTML to make this website, and hope I can do so efficiently. Though, I’m not exactly sure how I will go about creating the chat room and chat log aspects, I’m very excited to start and learn how to do so. If I have to use something other than HTML to create the look I want, I do not mind, but I will definitely ask for outside help if that so happens to be the case. Internet addiction is an important part of Internet culture, because it continues to affect more and more people every single day as the reaches of the Internet continue to expand.
